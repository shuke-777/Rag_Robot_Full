12. We present pipeline for the vsal localizatin nd classication ofag riculturalpst insects by

14. we used a global ontrast region-based approach to comput asaliency map for localizing pest
15. insect objects. Bounding quares ontaining targts were then extracted, rsized to fuxed size, and
16. use to construt a large standard database clld est D. This database was the tilized for elf
